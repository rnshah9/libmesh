/**
 * Temporarily serialize a DistributedMesh for non-distributed-mesh
 * capable code paths.  A distributed mesh is allgathered by the
 * MeshSerializer constructor if need_serial is true, in which case
 * remote elements are deleted again by the destructor.
 *
 * Serialization to processor 0 alone (e.g. for serial output from
 * that processor) can be selected in the constructor.
 *
 * If allow_remote_element_removal() is set to true, that will also be
 * temporarily disabled by the serializer, to be reenabled after
 * serializer distruction if so; this allows prepare_for_use() to be
 * called safely from within serialized code.
 *
 * If a mesh is explicitly distributed by a `delete_remote_elements()`
 * call within serialized code, or if allow_remote_element_removal()
 * is explicitly set to true within serialized code, the behavior is
 * undefined.
